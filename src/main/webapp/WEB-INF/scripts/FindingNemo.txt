MARLIN: No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.
DORY: Hey, I've seen a boat.
MARLIN: You have?
DORY: It passed by not too long ago.
MARLIN: A white one?
DORY: Hi. I'm Dory.
MARLIN: Where!? Which way!?
DORY: Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!
MARLIN: Thank you! Thank you, thank you so much!
DORY: No problem.
MARLIN: Hey! Wait!
DORY: Will you quit it?
MARLIN: What?
DORY: I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?
MARLIN: Huh?
DORY: You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah, oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?
MARLIN: Wait a minute..
DORY: Stop following me, okay!?
MARLIN: What? You're showing me which way the boat went!
DORY: A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this way. Follow me!
MARLIN: Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going!
DORY: I did? Oh dear...
MARLIN: If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!
DORY: No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.
MARLIN: Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this!
DORY: No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. 
DORY: It runs in my family..or at least I think it does. 
DORY: Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?
MARLIN: Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son.
